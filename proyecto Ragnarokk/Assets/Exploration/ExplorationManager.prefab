  Lore:
  - 'You find some human writings:

    Day 59 of the Tesla project.

    After almost
    2 months of tireless work, the project is almost finished.

    It has been hell
    to extract the gold from the specimens in its purest form.

    About 40 have
    died in the attempt. It is a real shame that when they die, more than 80% of
    their bodies turn to dust.

    However, we did get enough gold to test the Tesla''s
    Machine.

    It is the most advanced electricity technology ever. This will
    make it much easier to subdue the reptilians.'
  - 'Ard gives you a vision:

    You can see the rocky, dry land of Grandd. The
    horizon is disfigured by the heat.

    A group of Warrior Felsen returns from
    hunting some Bombo Bombo.

    They meet up with other group of Worker Felsen
    and throw the hunt in the middle.

    The Laborer Felsen are dedicating to extracting
    the diamonds from the Bombo Bombo, as that is the tastiest part.

    The atmosphere
    is suddenly upset. A Bombo Bombo is still alive, and he''s made a beast.

    The
    Laborers try to contain it. They are good at resisting its stampedes.

    Once
    cornered, a Warrior raises his Golden Hammer.

    It crushes it with such force
    that the diamonds fly through the air.

    Now they can start the feast.'
  - 'Notes from a Gaun''s Acolyte:

    A group of humans assaulted us recently with
    weapons of that poisonous substance.

    We were about to retreat, but a young
    took a Small Burner and pointed it at a human.

    "Fool!" I yelled at him.
    "That''s sacred! Gaun will punish you!"

    But the Small Burner was already
    incinerating that human, leaving him the color of the earth.

    We rethought
    our strategy, and decided to use Gaun''s weapons to save ourselves.

    Once
    again, Gaun has blessed us with his power.

    We took some weapons from the
    humans.

    Alcohol. That''s the name of the poisonous substance these guys
    are made of.

    Although it seems that it is not so poisonous after all.'
  - 'Remnants of psyche enter the minds of the group:

    Reddel was wounded by
    a group of Gorbs.

    The wound is serious, but I can feel that he does not
    intend to die.

    We have been cleaning The Unit of these aquatic creatures
    for decades.

    It amazes me how we stand firm knowing that any day we may
    fall in battle.

    I think that we can maintain Hope because we synergize with
    each other.

    Our psychic weapons breach the target''s mind, making it easier
    to continue damaging them.

    A Sleepy or Agitated mind is easy prey for psychics.

    Although
    sometimes we make mistakes and attack a Sleepy enemy with Water. That discourages
    us.'
